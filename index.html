        <h2 class="accordion-title">What is HTML?</h2>
        <p class="accordion-answer"> Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a computer language that makes up most web pages and online
            applications. A hypertext is a text that is used to reference other pieces of text, while a markup
            language is a series of markings that tells web servers the style and structure of a document. HTML
            is very simple to learn and use.</p>

        <h2 class="accordion-title">What is CSS?</h2>
        <p class="accordion-answer"> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language for describing the presentation of Web
            pages, including colours, layout, and fonts, thus making our web pages presentable to the users. CSS
            is designed to make style sheets for the web. It is independent of HTML and can be used with any
            XML-based markup language. CSS is popularly called the design language of the web.</p>

        <h2 class="accordion-title">What is JavaScript?</h2>
        <p class="accordion-answer">JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on
            web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for
            you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics,
            scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third
            of the web trio.</p>
